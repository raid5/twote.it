What went into it
-----------------

Twote.it is a simple Rails 3 app that came out of a brainstorm session between myself and [David Hoang](http://davidhoang.com). Overall, the project only took a few hours of design and development time. Our main focus was to create something simple and easy to use while working on our collaboration workflow.

The site utilizes OmniAuth for the Twitter sign in and the twitter_oauth gem to send a twote to your Twitter stream.
